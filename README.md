# Trillium Web Family Reception Centre Extension

This is a browser extension for the "Trillium" tool used at the Family Reception Centre at OCDSB.

## Features
- Separates and increases the sizes of the tiny little buttons under the main tabs, so that you can never tap on the wrong one.
- Removes the useless "Delete" button which is in the middle of the frequently used ones, saving you a lot of frustration.
- On the Find Student and Find Family page, use the "Return" or "Enter" key to search.
- (Chrome only) Adds a toggle in the popup menu to quickly activate and deactivate the extension.
